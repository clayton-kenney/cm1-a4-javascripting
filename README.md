## Prompt
### DOM Basics:
Getting Elements
* Get a reference to all the paragraph (p) tags in the document.
* Get a reference to a paragraph tag with a specific id of "second".
* Get a reference to a all paragraph tags with a class of "first".
* Get a reference to an element or elements within another element. For example, if you have an unordered list (ul) with several list items (li), how do you select a specific li and display it's contents to the console?
* Change the active color of the sidebar to red.

### Changing Elements
* Change the text within a sidebar list item (li) to "Foo". Change the text within the previously selected list item (li) to "Greetings List Item! I'm a string from another planet!".
* Change the text of a specific paragraph to a different string of text. Use an Ipsum generator tool to create new placeholder text that you insert using Javascript.

### Removing Elements
* Clear the contents of the paragraph with an id of "empty-me".
* Clear the contents of the set of paragraphs with class "empty-us".
* Remove the div with a specific id of "section3".

### Adding Elements
* Create a new anchor tag that links to your blog and insert it just after the paragraph tag in the div with an id of "about".
* Append a new div anywhere in the document and give it an id of your choice. Insert a paragraph with some content into the div using javascript.
* Add a new list item to the sidebar ul that links to your new div so you can click and scroll to it.
* Add a new list item with URL to www.google.com in the sidebar.

### Event Listeners
* Make an event listener for any h2 element that triggers an alert() when you click it. Set the alert message to "Hey Hey Hey!".
* Make an event listener that triggers a change in the text of a specific paragraph with the id "change-me".
